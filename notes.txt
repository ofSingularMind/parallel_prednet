Things to try:

Pass L+1 predictions down, instead of representation
Include in the error signal a second set of channels for delta error
Include parallel Prednets operating on different data image channels (depth, oFlow)
Try including more channels in the input (depth, oFlow), without parallel Prednets
Replace ConvLSTM with other more powerful models
Try custom dataset with moving objects
