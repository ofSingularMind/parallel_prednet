Things to try:

Pass L+1 predictions down, instead of representation
Include in the error signal a second set of channels for delta error
Try including more channels in the input (depth, oFlow), without parallel Prednets
Replace ConvLSTM with other more powerful models
Try custom dataset with moving objects
Include parallel Prednets operating on different data image channels (depth, oFlow)
Add Pan-Hierarchical Predictive Engine
Try different model weights for the different time-steps, at least for the first step, and subsequent steps. The idea is that the first step should bring the representation closely to the previous frame, and subsequent ones should operate on the differences between frames.
